          The hard part here will be getting the 5 gold quality parsnips, as you must do this in spring and your farming skill is starting out low.

          Be sure to plant a good number of parsnips, say 15 right from the first day.

          When you harvest keep replanting at least until you have 5 quality ones, but also consider keep planting more as they are fast growing and harvesting them will help you level up your farming skill.

          You will probably get the parsnip while trying for the 5 gold ones, but you will need to plant the other 3 crops as well in time to harvest in spring.

          It is worth planting green beans as early as possible as they can give multiple harvests, for maximum harvests plant before the 3rd day.

          You will get 20 speed-gro as a reward, which if used in summer for Blueberries will give an extra harvest.
